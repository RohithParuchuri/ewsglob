        EXPT.NO: 01 STRAIGHT FIT

2x2 802.11ac

AIM: To make a Straight fit from the given mid steel pieces.

MATERIALS REQUIRED: mild steel flat (48*48*5mm).

TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:

1.6" try square

2.6" scriber

3. Odd leg calliper

3.12" hack saw Frame

4 Blades (12 TPI)

5. 10" rough file

6. 10" smooth file

7. 10" Square file

8. Dot punch

9. Ball peen hammer (0.5 Ib).

10. Steel Rule

Sequence of OPERATIONS:

1. Filling

2. Marking

3. Punching

4. Sawing

5. Filling

6. Finishing PROCEDURE:

1. The given mild steel flat piece is checked for given dimensions.

40

2. One edge of given is filled to straightness with rough and smooth files and checked with try square.

3. An adjacent is also filled such that is square to first edge and checked with try square.

4. Wet chalk is applied on one side of the flat and dried for making.

5. Lines are marked according to given figure, using odd leg calliper and steel rule.

6. using the dot punch are made along the marked lines.

7. The excess materials removed from the remaining two edges with try square level up to half of the marked dots.

8. Finally buts are removed by the filling on the surface of the fitted job.

PRECAUTIONS:

1. The perpendicular of face ends edges is checked perfectly by using try square.

2. Finishing is given by using only with smooth files.

3. Marking is done without parallax error.

RESULT: The Straight fit is done successfully
