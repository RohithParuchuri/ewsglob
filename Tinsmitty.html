        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p>Tinsmithy encompasses the study of working with thin metal sheets, including techniques for cutting, shaping,
            bending, and joining metals like tin, aluminum, or light alloys to create various products such as
            containers, roofing materials, and decorative items. It also involves understanding metal properties, safety
            measures, and the use of specialized tools and equipment in the tinsmithing process.</p>
