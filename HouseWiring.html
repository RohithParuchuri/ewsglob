        <h1>Introduction:</h1>
        <p>House wiring encompasses the principles of electrical circuitry, including understanding electrical codes and
            regulations, selecting appropriate cables and components, planning circuit layouts, and implementing safety
            measures to ensure the safe and effective distribution of electrical power throughout a building.</p>


            EXPT NO 1: TWO LAMPS CONNECTED IN SERIES AND ONE LAMP CONNECTED IN PARALLEL USING ON WAY SWITCH

AIM: To connect Two lamps connected in series and one lamp connected in parallel using on way

switch MATERIALS REQUIRED WITH DIMENSIONS:

1. 1/18" pve wire of sufficient length

2. One-way switch-2 no.

3. Two-pin plug socket-Ino.

4. Bulb-Ino.

5. Bulb holder-Ino.

TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT

USED:

1. 6" cutting pliers

2. 1.5 IB ball peen hammer.

3. Wire stripper

4. Tester

5. 6" screw drivers

6. Hack saw

7. 12mm hand drilling machine.

Neutral

Phase

one way switch

OPERATIONS TO BE CARRIED OUT:

1. Fitting the wires

2. Connection of the bulb holder

3. Connection of plug socket

4. Connection of switch

5. Circuit connections 6. Power from mains

7. Operation the bulb

8. Testing the plug socket.

PROCEDURE:

Pha ba

Phas

1 . The outline wiring diagram marked on the wooden board and clips are nailed to the board following the diagram, six wire pieces are taken, and insulation is removed at the ends by using wire stripper.

2. A phase wire is connected to one-point switch sl and s2.

3. The lower points of switches slands2 are connected to one point of bulb holder and one point of plug socket respectively.

4. Two neutral wires are taken and one in connected to the remaining point of the bulb holder.

5. The other is connected to the remaining points of plug socket.

6. After checking the proper circuit connections the power supply is given. 7. Now the bulb is ready to glow bright and the plug socket is also ready with control.

PRECAUTIONS:

1. All the wire connections of the switches, bulb holder and sockets be tight.

2. Too many load connections fr4om a single junction is avoided.

RESULT: Two lamps are connected in series and one lamp connected in parallel using oneway switch
